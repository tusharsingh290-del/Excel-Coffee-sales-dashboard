# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Excel dashboard that visualizes coffee sales data to uncover trends in product performance, customer preferences, and seasonal patterns. It was built using Excel formulas and data visualization tools to provide actionable insights for coffee retailers or analysts.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The raw dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and usability:
- Removed duplicates and null values
- Standardized date formats and product names
- Filtered out irrelevant entries
- Organized data into structured tables for analysis

## 🧮 Excel Formulas Used
Key formulas and functions used in the dashboard:
- `SUM`: To calculate total sales by flavor, size, and date
- `XLOOKUP`: For dynamic data retrieval across tables
- `IF`, `COUNTIF`, `TEXT`: Used for conditional logic, frequency analysis, and formatting

- **Top-Selling Sizes**: Identifies which coffee cup sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) are most popular
